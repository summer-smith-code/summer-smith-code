* Hiya, my name is Summer Smith!
* I'm a UCF undergrad sophomore studying game design, specializing in 3D modeling and programming. 
* I enjoy animated shows, languages, sewing, and games.

* As I expand my skillset in C and C++, my Github will serve as a collection of my current and past projects.

* Check out my portfolio [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFO_saeCcpQ7Lyek330oXnOScunbF_WzLZEu6cLVhTw/edit?usp=sharing)
